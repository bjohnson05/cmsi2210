# Problems for Assignment #3
## Learning Objectives:
<blockquote>
  1. Understanding different number representations<br />
  2. Practice with the different common number bases used by computers<br />
  3. Practice translating values between different bases<br />
  4. Practice translating values between different representations<br />
  5. Practice/understanding of carry, overflow, saturated, and modular computer arithmetic
</blockquote>

Please do all these problems WITHOUT using a computer or calculator.

The purpose of these exercises is to help you develop your skill.

Taking the time to practice will give you a better ability and understanding of the material.

Remember that the prefix "0x" or "0X" indicates that a value is shown in hexadecimal [base 16].

          <li>Hex C0FF0000, when interpreted as an IEEE-754 pattern, is in decimal:
      </ol>

These problems are difficult and will require you to do some research to get the answers.  <strong>They are considered optional</strong> and you will get extra credit for getting them correct, one point per problem.  For any you attempt for which the answer is <em><u>incorrect</u></em>, you will NOT be penalized, you just won't get any credit for them.
